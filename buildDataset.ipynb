(context, scope, purpose, etc.)nice chart. lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information.my questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind i'm a totally lay an alphabet is used to 1. communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2. describe that communication (unambigously) rightcertain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are). i have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention mandarin chinese (etc.)does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages written what about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff). sign-language we now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but i digress. from a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed. i suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks. so what does the ipa doit just occured to me that maybe the ipa is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation

it used to be. it used to be precise as to what it meant; much of that precision has been removed. the result is the sublte introduction of errors... in part by removing that precision. for example, the ring over tau_p is not isomorphic to the ring x^n^p which is what you seem to be implying; the degrees of polynomials are totatlly if p(tau) is a polynomial, then n^(deg p(tau)) = deg p(x) one is kind-of-like the exp/ad of the other, sort-of. and you cut out the paragraphs that made this tau a is not equal to a tau, but tau a is equal to a^p tau ...the ring is never commutative when the field is not f_p ... the field is called f_p not z/pz dammit. we already talked about this before. nobody but you calls it that.stating that ap(x) is also additive is important, i don't see why you cut that out. k{tau} is not k[x] e.g the next theorem to mention is that for any p(x) in k[x] there exists a g(tau) in k{tau} such that f(x) divides g(x). these g(tau)'s are a left ideal in k{tau}using language like ``its quite easy to prove`` and ``it follows quickly`` and ``it can be shown that`` is, at best, filler, and, at worst, misleading as to the actual difficulty of the theorems you are alluding to.look, i don't see why you need to be monkeying with this article, why don't you write an article on ore's invariants of the additive polynomials, or the moore determinant instead, hell, there is no entry for the vandermonde determinant even ... or start the article on a carlitz module or drinfeld module instead, or fix the article on non-archimedean analysis which really needs a lot of work, cause its missing all that jazz ... `  \n25475

artical it was. and i will apologise to you too. it seemes my little brother finds it funny to mess with wikipedia, as i type this i'm downloading a site blocker program so he cant access your site anymore, sorry==gfdl license==i have come across pictures without any mention of gfdl. one such image is chessset2.jpg. since i think you are assuming the role of a moderator, i am intimating it to you. ==about the micronation article==i know you don't accept the fifth world nations even though they exist as part of the micronational phenomenon. but i hope you will take note of the work i did today at the micronation article, and just what kind of contributions were eliminated and reverted because ``vandal`` - i thought it was the destroyers of info who were the vandals - from .i don't expect him to be banned by you, but i think you should ask him why he keeps eliminating new information about the micronational world when it doesn't regard his nation.i don't believe 's edits are done in good faith, because they are not edits, but mere distruction of articles. you are an admin, and you should look at this objectively. otherwise the micronation article will only reflect the ideas/biases/knowledge of . that would not be a disservice to me, but to wikipedia in the long-term. ==reply==i replied to your message at . — i responded to your question in yoshitoshi abe. (it's on my watchlist, so just put all further responses there. =='s reply==does what you say about ``3 reverts and you're out for a day`` make a difference do you actually think i even care at this point if hasn't been banned already with what he's done — just look at his micronation article, then look at mine at — can you expect me to keep wasting my time with it do you think that real nation builders have the stomach for low life crap artists like the emperor of atlantium doesn't want fifth world (5w) nations mentioned, and the reason he doesn't is perfectly logical in his praying mantis-like it's the only way his foolish, immoral, and useless nation can compete with the likes of a 5w nation. he doesn't like the 5w not because it is ``incoherent drivel,`` but because it is the very opposite. read this article to get an education, if you still care about getting one on the ttf-bucksfan related news.if his article on the empire of atlantium hasn't been voted for deletion yet (sysops can do that, not me), and i have no evidence that it was, nor that it could possibly survive such scrutiny, then what's my purpose here it is certainly not to write a better and more comprehensive micronational articlei have better things to do with my life, and i'll just write my own articles in my user file, where they don't bother nobody seeking publicity from the wikipedia, and who finds the truth compromising to his success. i'll write my own articles if i feel like it. can't make and will never make any real history with atlantium, so he's chosen to do the next best make his nation seem relevant in the wikipedia, when in reality it isn't even relevant within the micronational community. == baseball at the 2004 summer olympics ==hi rick,i wrote this quickly today following roughly how somebody had started the football at the 2004 summer olympics. i haven't looked into how they progress from the preliminary rounds to the semis so if you know it will be easier to redesign the page. if not wait a few days i'll get back to it== baseball at the 2004 summer olympics ==done, took me a few go's as i has copied the layout but it seems you have to start with {| at the begiining of a group of dates and end with |} remebering to {| at the start of the next. scraggy4== baseball at the 2004 summer olympics ==done, took me a few go's as i has copied the layout but it seems you have to start with {| at the begiining of a group of dates and end with |} remebering to {| at the start of the next. scraggy4== taipei v taiwan ==hi rick,when i noticed that you had changed taipei to taiwan on the baseball at the 2004 summer olympics i presumed that you had changed it because i had made a mistake so i went down the fixtures and changed them all to taiwan, since which i came across a sub-page of the official olympics site that states that taipei are the team playing. did you just make a mistake or are you a baseball addict that has noticed they got the official page wrongregards == what am i up to true or false ==i've been writing test messages to users i've seen vandalism reverted. true or among the anti-vandalizers, you are the strongest. ==delete/speedy you've obviously been around for a while, so could you use the vfd page properly please. 'ladies' should have been marked for speedy delete (using {{delete}}), and not put in vfd. plus, you didn't adopt the standard formatting. cheers. ==honour -> honor==old habits die hard. sorry rick. ==tupac edit==you posted your edits to the tupac shakur article 10 minutes after i posted changes to the rise to fame portion and reverted much of what i did. i was wondering if this was on purpose or an accident (we both checked out the same version and you copied over what i did). i'm not asking about the early life part, just the rise to fame part. your message to me==i am aware of and the other user's edits. i do post anti-wiki information on my livejournal, and yes you are mentioned many times. yes that person is a friend of mine, his name is andrew weil he was making fun of (note i don't find any of weil's edits to be funny and as a matter of fact i'm on vacation) i'll call him up and tell him to stop. btw rick i talked to grazingshipiv on aim and he insisted that was you, and i defended your name. ' 39, 13 jul my goal is not to troll rick, all i wish to do is increase wiki love, nothing else, i'm sorry if i mentioned you in my livejoural, i'm mentally unstable. ' 45, 13 jul 2004== israel ==any further thoughts on kingdom of israel what about kingdom of judah 15, 2004 jul 14 those look good, to me. can i remove the listing on cleanup 16, 2004 jul 14 yes, go ahead, remove them from cleanup. ok, done. 33, 2004 jul 14 (utc)i just saw that you reverted edits by 63.231.226.163 adding several latin american leaders to the cold war people category. it is quite a broad category, and i'm not necessarily sure if it makes sense for one to exist; but so long as the category exists, it does seem reasonable to lump trujillo, guzman, and noriega in it. are you in the process of substantially narrowing down the category, or is there another reason that you feel that they do not belong in it thanks for the response. i looked through 63.231.226.163's user history and he/she does seem to be making the category way too broad. this is quite a problematic category; go ahead and scrap the category altogether if you wish. or perhaps it could be limited to the bio pieces that link to cold war ( == intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ==hi, i'm wondering why you speedy deleted intermodal surface transportation efficiency act. i saw this come across in the new pages and went to read it, only to see that it was gone before i had a chance. it is an actual act, and the summary in the deletion log doesn't really show any problems. thanks thanks for the response. ==erika slezak==ne  \n25521

your immediat removal from the case as completely unable to distinguish on this basic fact.you are of no good at all and i certainly do not wish for an arbitration comity to be formed of people who do not have any conscience nor ethic, nor sense of duty, and who don't even look at the case at hand nor read what the arbitration subject is about, before emitting their opinionated evaluations and sentences.so rest in peace and might you not be resurected ever. : btw, xal (or ``sophie`` or whomever you are), i usually don't read your rantings (i responded to your post above that ended with the sweet ``let's work together as a team`` because it didn't sound like a rant), but this was pointed to in fact, i was blocked for 24 hours along with igor by , for 3rr violation. but there is a i submitted to the block, i didn't go unregistered and find another ip to post anyway, but igor did not submit to it. he refused to abide by and posted to this talk page above ``dear marudubshinki...`` this suggests that igor believes he is above the rules. the 3rr doesn't apply to him, does this reminds me of a time when i was a kid and we were saying ``table grace`` before our meal. my parents told us all that we had to be reverend, bow our heads, and close our eyes when we were praying our table prayer. well, i left mine open and so did my much younger brother and when the prayer was over, he immediately tattled on me saying to our parents that ``bob didn't close his eyes for the prayer.`` geee, how did he well, it was igor who made the complaint of the many reversions of mine and the admins decided (correctly) that he was reverting just as often as i was and the blocked us both. but since the rules don't apply to igor, he went and posted (using ip address for instead of logging in to his account) anyway. it seems to me that the timing of this refusal to abide by his block was coincidental to when snowspinner's tolerance for igor's arrogance hit his/her limit and that's when the ``excrement`` really hit the fan for igor. rjb or whomever you are, i am the alone one ever in wiki on this case, both english and french who has posted with her full name and adress and telephon number and private emails, twice, and referes most of the time with both ip adress and real name, even before i had my own registration name on wiki, so suck your puppets if cyber leaking make it

for your notice.i appreciate your inputs in image monkey3.jpg and i agree once in a while i might sound rude (purely unintentional, since i put facts blantly). but slimvirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.slim is not a ``he``. given that she named herself after a javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. also, i don't think you were simply blunt. i think you were rude to slim. i recognise it's a fine line but given that i've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of itshe has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. now, i don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. she could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. i think that would be reasonable. i have a high regard for slim and i don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.inso far as the images are concerned, i had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by peta and its assocites.so you have a dispute. you need to recognise that you are not necessarily right you disagree about how many images are necessary. i feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.this should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.the buav is not a ``controversial organisation``. it is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of british society. a viewpoint doesn't become ``controversial`` just because you don't share it.wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - but you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.thus i requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.i don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. while i agree that slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, i simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. one factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.as far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ``agreed`` to use their photos here. unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can i believe.first of all, you can believe slim because you assume good faith. perhaps you're not aware of that policy. yes, you can ask slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.once i pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.yes, okay. trust her and ask for proof.both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.i'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. yes, slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.if she gets away with this and sets a precedence then i'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb wikipedia with copyrighted information.i think that's a bit dramatic but i agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. however, she is not a ``copyviolater`` trying to destroy wikipedia. partly, i think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. so perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative i know it's hard. i find the establishment hard to deal with sometimes. they tend to say ``wikipedia thinks this...`` when they mean ``my friends think this...`` they forget the diversity and multiplicity of opinion that exists here and live in an echo chamber because they know they are empowered and do not need to pay any attention to that diversity to get what they want.fyi, 70% of her images are tagged as fair use without providing a single rationale (few of them fall under the subcategories like stamp, logo etc. where it's easy to understand).yes. but as i noted, plain common sense would direct you to understand that fair use is being made of the photos. they are the product of a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to educate people about animal torture. having their material illustrate an encyclopaedia article about animal torture would clearly suit their purpose, as slim pointed out to you, i believe. ignoring that makes your approach seem malicious. i think slim is in part bewildered by your making such a huge, urgent issue out of it, when the chances of legal dispute are so very small. so perhaps we could agree that slim should provide rationales in due course, and preferably have the photos released under a suitable licence, but in the meantime there's no particular urgency to re-tag them or to insist on rapid action surely a commitment to act would be sufficient.she also keeps reverting to her tags, violating all admin rules. that's another issue. i think slim is one of many admins who would be better off not having the powers, because they lead her into disputes of this nature, where the issue all too rapidly becomes her and not her edits, which is unfortunate.as it stands i'm erring on the side of caution, while slim wants to stretch the boundry of ``fair use``. tx 4 ur interest in this. ''i agree that you're being very cautious, and i think caution is right, as i noted. however, i think in the case of the buav images in particular that they are clearly ``fairly used``. you have to ignore their provenance to think otherwise. i can see from your discussion with her that slim was not very successful in communicating her point of view, because she interpreted legitimate concern over copyright for a personal attack, largely because, i think, you didn't take into account the source of the photos and their likely reaction to their being in wp. still, i do agree that she should ask for confirmation from buav that they are cool with our using the photos; but i think you should lay off them (and her) so long as she has made the commitment to acquire that confirmation.

but you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.thus i requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.i don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. while i agree that slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, i simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. one factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.as far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ``agreed`` to use their photos here. unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can i believe.first of all, you can believe slim because you assume good faith. perhaps you're not aware of that policy. yes, you can ask slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.once i pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.yes, okay. trust her and ask for proof.both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.i'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. yes, slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.if she gets away with this and sets a precedence then i'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb wikipedia with copyrighted information.i think that's a bit dramatic but i agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. however, she is not a ``copyviolater`` trying to destroy wikipedia. partly, i think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. so perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative i know it's hard. i find the establishment hard to deal with sometimes. they tend to say ``wikipedia thinks this...`` when they mean ``my friends think this...`` they forget the diversity and multiplicity of opinion that exists here and live in an echo chamber because they know they are empowered and do not need to pay any attention to that diversity to get what they want.fyi, 70% of her images are tagged as fair use without providing a single rationale (few of them fall under the subcategories like stamp, logo etc. where it's easy to understand).yes. but as i noted, plain common sense would direct you to understand that fair use is being made of the photos. they are the product of a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to educate people about animal torture. having their material illustrate an encyclopaedia article about animal torture would clearly suit their purpose, as slim pointed out to you, i believe. ignoring that makes your approach seem malicious. i think slim is in part bewildered by your making such a huge, urgent issue out of it, when the chances of legal dispute are so very small. so perhaps we could agree that slim should provide rationales in due course, and preferably have the photos released under a suitable licence, but in the meantime there's no particular urgency to re-tag them or to insist on rapid action surely a commitment to act would be sufficient.she also keeps reverting to her tags, violating all admin rules. that's another issue. i think slim is one of many admins who would be better off not having the powers, because they lead her into disputes of this nature, where the issue all too rapidly becomes her and not her edits, which is unfortunate.as it stands i'm erring on the side of caution, while slim wants to stretch the boundry of ``fair use``. tx 4 ur interest in this.

`==they use abusive and illegal measures==these are the arguments posted on the page of ``moldovan language``.for these facts many users have been blocked and more forced to accept an unilateral point of view of the administrator mikkalai and 16 years old kid node _ue. he does not bring arguments as we do, instead he uses his power to block many times (for one week or 24 h). like for yourself, he warned you and mock on you saying that you don't have the right to say something.i agree with you when you say to redirect to ``romanian language``. anyway ``romanian`` was once recognized in the constitution as official language of the moldova between 1991-1994 and many attempts to remake this were done.``moldovan language`` is in fact indentical with romanian language, renamed as a ``language`` for political reasons by the government. although similar theories have been fielded for other languages, this proposal is now believed to have been made to serve political purposes only, and nobody has provided any evidence so-far towards the idea that moldovan and romanian are not from common linguistic stock.the term ``moldovan`` is also a soviet invention (see dept. of state & cia). a separate language based on these was declared and promoted for political reasons, in order to further advance a moldovan identity separate from that of romania.the soviet russians called people of moldavia ``moldovan`` because they wanted to create a new nation different from moldavians/romanians. there is also in romania a region called moldova. russians manipulated people of republic of moldova and washed their brains to create a new person, the soviet ``moldovan``. the real name in english is moldavian, in romanian is moldovean and in russian is molidavanin. so ``moldovan`` belongs to no language from price, glanville. encyclopedia of the languages of europe. isbn 0631220399; blackwell publishers, oxford, uk; april very interesting. for those who bother making a click on the link i will ``the name 'moldovan language' (in russian, молдaвckий язбik 'moldavskii iazyk');in romanian, limbă moldovenească, or, in cyrillic characters, лиmбз moлдоbeняckзwas applied in the soviet union, as during earlier periods of russian occupation of the area in question, to the * romance language used in the moldavian soviet socialist republic (corresponding more or less to the formerly romanian territory of bessarabia, annexed by the soviet union in 1940). in reality, 'moldavian' is nothing else than the *romanian language as spoken in moldavia, i.e. both east of the river prut in bessarabia (now the republic of moldova) and west of the prut in that part of the former province that remains as part of romania. claims made in the post-second world war period by the soviet linguists that 'moldavian' should be recognized as a distinct romance language were not taken into seriously by western scholars.under soviet domination, the *cyrillic alphabet was in the use in the moldavian ssr until the passing of a law on 31 august 1989 (i.e. before the break-up of the soviet union) proclaiming moldavian as the official language of the republic and the use of latin script. apart from a few lexical differences (mainly technical terms borrowed from russian rather than, as in standard romanian, from western languages), the written language was thenceforth indistinguishable from that in use in romania and moves are afoot to harmonize the technical terminology of moldova with that adopted in romanian specialized dictionaries.after the republic of moldova declared its independence of the soviet union in 1991, its constitution (1994) declared that the official language was limba moldoveneasca 'the moldavian language'. at the time of writing, moves to have this amended to 'limba română' the romanian language have not yet succeeded.heitmann, k., 1989, moldauisch. in holtus, g., metzeltin, m. and schmitt, c. (eds), lexicon der romanschinen linguistik, tübingen, vol 3. 508-21. glanville price`` even at the internationally level (officially) is recognized that in moldova the people speak romanian. just for your record the us state dept. (their foreign office), the french ministry of foreign affairs(france), the uk foreign office (uk), the german ministry of foreign affairs (germany) are stating one in moldova it is spoken romanian. romanian is the official language even if the name is moldovan. for the others motivated ``moldovan language`` followers please check the german foreign ministry, germany us state department, (``..stalin justified the creation of the moldavian ssr by claiming that a distinct ``moldavian`` language was an indicator that ``moldavians`` were a separate nationality from the romanians in france – ministere des affaires – foreign & commonwealth except the russian are in the same manner. all the western powers refuse the russification attempts.==artificial creation of the ``moldavian language``. evolution from romanian to so called moldavian==lately were discovered some facts that prove that the theory of the both languages romanian and ``moldovan`` - was prefab since the 1812-1918. some important aspects of the functioning of the romanian language in the sphere of the laic education system from bessarabia of the year 1812-1918, the attempts to codyfing the romanian language in conditions of a linguistic situations, causes that determined to degradation of the language compared with spoken romanian on the right side of the river prut, taking out the name ``romanian`` and introducing the term ``limba moldoveneasca``, the intention of the tsarist government ``to create a dialect neared to the slavic language``.in the first years of russian occupation (after 1812), because 95% of the population being romanians which they knew only their mother tongue, romanian was admitted as an official language in the institutions of bessarabia, used along with russian. gradually the russian language win importance. according to the dates offered by the dept. for ruling the bessarabia from 1828, the papers from bureau were held only in russian, and around 1835 it is established a term of 7 years time in which the state institutions will still accept acts in romanian language. as concerning the education, romanian was admitted as language of teaching only until 1842, after that being taught as a separate object. thus, at the theological seminar of chişinău, romanian language is found on the list of compulsory subjects, with 10 hours weekly, until 1863, when the department of romanian is closed for good. at the highschool no. 1 from chişinău the pupils had the right to choose between romanian and german or between romanian and greek until 9th of feb. 1866, when the state counselor of the russian government interdicts teaching of the romanian language because the pupils ``know this language in the practical mode, and its teaching follows other goals``. around 1871, the tsar published an ucaz ``on the suspension of teaching the romanian language in the schools from besserabia``, because ``in russian empire are not taught local speeches``.two examples of the identity were (one is from the constitution of both countries – see the identity)=== comparison romanian/moldavian ===the example below demonstrates that a formal text

has been the worst nightmare i have ever had the singular displeasure of be subjectified by. but-in i was right about the mitchell award, i was right about the e-2/e-3 issue, i was 'factully' correct on the nixon article revision, and i am now just going about my business and mr. mcneight has to just go on his way and cry over the fact that he has so much time on his hands he can call loud-mouthed bully, pathetic, and accuse me of threatening him. of coursei don't know who or where this rude creature is-but i'm sure he is simply threatened by my far superior intellectual abilities. further, he has had his cronies attack me on his behalf which is something i would expect from a sixth-grader. oh well, i'm sure that his grand contributions to the ford pinto article are nearly as valuable of the article i wrote on navcruit 1133.101 the he had deleted with two hours what a rude and disgusting action to take that the 'deletion' was made by who also accuse me of threatening mcdork from an ip

is clear.on the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the ipa is.

anyway, but igor did not submit to it. he refused to abide by and posted to this talk page above ``dear marudubshinki...`` this suggests that igor believes he is above the rules. the 3rr doesn't apply to him, does this reminds me of a time when i was a kid and we were saying ``table grace`` before our meal. my parents told us all that we had to be reverend, bow our heads, and close our eyes when we were praying our table prayer. well, i left mine open and so did my much younger brother and when the prayer was over, he immediately tattled on me saying to our parents that ``bob didn't close his eyes for the prayer.`` geee, how did he well, it was igor who made the complaint of the many reversions of mine and the admins decided (correctly) that he was reverting just as often as i was and the blocked us both. but since the rules don't apply to igor, he went and posted (using ip address for instead of logging in to his account) anyway. it seems to me that the timing of this refusal to abide by his block was coincidental to when snowspinner's tolerance for igor's arrogance hit his/her limit and that's when the ``excrement`` really hit the fan for igor. rjb or whomever you are, i am the

overrule anyone.slim is not a ``he``. given that she named herself after a javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. also, i don't think you were simply blunt. i

that she is in talks with another editor. now, i don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. she could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. i think that would be reasonable. i have a high regard for slim and i don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.inso far as the images are concerned, i had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by peta and its assocites.so you have a dispute. you need to recognise that you are not necessarily right you disagree about how many images are necessary. i feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.this should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.the buav is not a ``controversial organisation``. it is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of british society. a viewpoint doesn't become ``controversial`` just because you don't share it.wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - but you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.thus i requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.i don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. while i agree that slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, i simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. one factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.as far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ``agreed`` to use their photos here. unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can i believe.first of all, you can believe slim because you assume good faith. perhaps you're not aware of that policy. yes, you can ask slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.once i pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.yes, okay. trust her and ask for proof.both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.i'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. yes, slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.if she gets away with this and sets a precedence then i'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb wikipedia with copyrighted information.i think that's a bit dramatic but i agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. however, she is not a ``copyviolater`` trying to destroy wikipedia. partly, i think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. so perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative i know it's hard. i find the establishment hard to deal with sometimes. they tend to say ``wikipedia thinks this...`` when they mean ``my friends think this...`` they forget the diversity and multiplicity of opinion that exists here and live in an echo chamber because they know they are empowered and do not need to pay any attention to that diversity to get what they want.fyi, 70% of her images are tagged as fair use without providing a single rationale (few of them fall under the subcategories like stamp, logo etc. where it's easy to understand).yes. but as i noted, plain common sense would direct you to understand that fair use is being made of the photos. they are the product of a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to educate people about animal torture. having their material illustrate an encyclopaedia article about animal torture would clearly suit their purpose, as slim pointed out to you, i believe. ignoring that makes your approach seem malicious. i think slim is in part bewildered by your making such a huge, urgent issue out of it, when the chances of legal dispute are so very small. so perhaps we could agree that slim should provide rationales in due course, and preferably have the photos released under a suitable licence, but in the meantime there's no particular urgency to re-tag them or to insist on rapid action surely a commitment to act would be sufficient.she also keeps reverting to her tags, violating all admin rules. that's another issue. i think slim is one of many admins who would be better off not having the powers, because they lead her into disputes of this nature, where the issue all too rapidly becomes her and not her edits, which is unfortunate.as it stands i'm erring on the side of caution, while slim wants to stretch the boundry of ``fair use``. tx 4 ur interest in this. ''i agree that you're being very cautious, and i think caution is right, as i noted. however, i think in the case of the buav images in particular that they are clearly ``fairly used``. you have to ignore their provenance to think otherwise. i can see from your discussion with her that slim was not very successful in communicating her point of view, because she interpreted legitimate concern over copyright for a personal attack, largely because, i think, you didn't take into account the source of the photos and their likely reaction to their being in wp. still, i do agree that she should ask for confirmation from buav that they are cool with our using the photos; but i think you should lay off them (and her) so long as she has made the commitment to acquire that confirmation.

language``. evolution from romanian to so called moldavian==lately were discovered some facts that prove that the theory of the both languages romanian and ``moldovan`` - was prefab since the 1812-1918. some important aspects of the functioning of the romanian language in the sphere of the laic education system from bessarabia of the year 1812-1918, the attempts to codyfing the romanian language in conditions of a linguistic situations, causes that determined to degradation of the language compared with spoken romanian on the right side of the river prut, taking out the name ``romanian`` and introducing the term ``limba moldoveneasca``, the intention of the tsarist government ``to create a dialect neared to the slavic language``.in the first years of russian occupation (after 1812), because 95% of the population being romanians which they knew only their mother tongue, romanian was admitted as an official language in the institutions of bessarabia, used along with russian. gradually the russian language win importance. according to the dates offered by the dept. for ruling the bessarabia from 1828, the papers from bureau were held only in russian, and around 1835 it is established a term of 7 years time in which the state institutions will still accept acts in romanian language. as concerning the education, romanian was admitted as language of teaching only until 1842, after that being taught as a separate object. thus, at the theological seminar of chişinău, romanian language is found on the list of compulsory subjects, with 10 hours weekly, until 1863, when the department of romanian is closed for good. at the highschool no. 1 from chişinău the pupils had the right to choose between romanian and german or between romanian and greek until 9th of feb. 1866, when the state counselor of the russian government interdicts teaching of the romanian language because the pupils ``know this language in the practical mode, and its teaching follows other goals``. around 1871, the tsar published an ucaz ``on the suspension of teaching the romanian language in the schools from besserabia``, because ``in russian empire are not taught local speeches``.two examples of the identity were (one is from the constitution of both countries – see the identity)=== comparison romanian/moldavian ===the example below demonstrates that a formal text
